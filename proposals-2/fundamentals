allows first-class inline assembly.

_main:
    # mov x0, #0
    ret


easily write multi isa code

_main:
# x64       mov eax, #0
#           ret ; test for multi-line asm
# aarch64   mov w0, #0
# arm       mov r0, #0
    ret

has defer keyword. will happen exiting scope
_main:
    # sub sp, sp, #0x10
    defer # add sp, sp, #0x10
    ret
